# Amazon_Clone
This project is a frontend clone of the Amazon shopping website, built using HTML and CSS to demonstrate web development skills. The design includes a navigation bar with features like a search bar, account management, and a shopping cart. The layout also showcases various product categories in a visually appealing grid format. The footer is designed to mimic Amazon's, providing links to different sections such as customer service, career opportunities, and payment options. Overall, this project serves as a basic but effective example of recreating a complex e-commerce interface with fundamental web technologies.
